<div id="welcome-to-the-ddmore-thoughtflow-community-group" class="section level2">
<h2>Welcome to the DDMoRe Thoughtflow Community Group!</h2>
<p>This website serves as the home for the Thoughtflow Community Group, including all of our code and resources for anyone wishing to learn about provenance and workflow capture, associated tools and technologies in the context of model informed drug discovery and development (MID3). Thoughtflow was initially developed as part of the <a href="http://ddmore.eu/product/pharmacometric-workflow">IMI DDMoRe project</a>.</p>
<div id="what-is-thoughtflow" class="section level3">
<h3>What is Thoughtflow?</h3>
<p>Thoughtflow is a combination of workflow capture (inputs to outputs), provenance capture (what output entities are associated with input entities, activities, and agents), querying and manipulation of provenance information from a database of provenance information.</p>
</div>
<div id="where-can-i-find-details-about-provenance-prov-o-and-thoughtflow" class="section level3">
<h3>Where can I find details about provenance, PROV-O and Thoughtflow?</h3>
<p>The IMI DDMoRe project has produced a <a href="Capturing_Pharmacometrics_Workflow_Concepts_with_PROV-O_311016.pdf">draft technical document</a> about the use of provenance capture using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/">PROV-O ontology</a> as the basis for a controlled vocabulary of provenance. An accompanying white paper will be published in <a href="Clinical%20Pharmacology%20&amp;%20Therapeutics:%20Pharmacometrics%20&amp;%20Systems%20Pharmacology">http://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)2163-8306/</a> in the first quarter of 2017.</p>
</div>
<div id="whats-next" class="section level3">
<h3>What’s next?</h3>
<p>This afternoon, the first kickoff meeting for the DDMoRe Foundation’s Community Groups will take place. This is where we hope to recruit our team</p>
