## Interest in Thoughtflow...
We're delighted to see the interest in Thoughtflow from the community at large! Thanks to everyone who has expressed interest. We'll soon be ready to schedule our first meeting - there'll be a Doodle coming soon. 

For those not able to join the kickoff meeting in January, the slides presented are available online at [ddmore.wpengine.com/community-groups](https://ddmore.wpengine.com/community-groups/). Registration is [still open](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/XS7HGR5), but please sign up before Friday 3 February if you'd like to come to the first meeting.

See you soon!
